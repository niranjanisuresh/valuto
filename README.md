#PRESENTING VALUTO
I built Valuto, a full-stack currency converter app, using React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot with Java 21 for the backend. The app lets users easily convert currency values between international standards in real-time. I designed a clean, responsive UI with React hooks and integrated it with a robust REST API built in Spring Boot.
During development, I tackled real-world challenges such as CORS policy hurdles by configuring cross-origin resource sharing properly in the backend, and data format mismatches by adjusting frontend parsing methods. I also structured the project for scalability by separating frontend and backend codebases, enabling independent development and deployment.
I deployed the frontend on Vercel and backend on Heroku, gaining hands-on experience with cloud deployment and environment variable management. This project enhanced my skills in asynchronous API handling, Java backend development, and deployment workflows.
Moving forward, I plan to integrate live exchange rate APIs and build a richer user experience with currency selectors and historical rate charts. This project is a demonstration of my full-stack competence, attention to detail, and ability to deliver user-focused solutions.”

Project Overview
Project name:
        Valuto — Currency Converter
Technologies:
        React.js, Java Spring Boot
Key goal: 
        Accurate, real-time currency conversion

Architecture:
Frontend (valuto) - React SPA
Backend (backend) - Spring Boot REST API
Communication: REST calls with query params

Challenges & Solutions
CORS errors — Solved with Spring’s @CrossOrigin
API response parsing — Adjusted frontend from JSON to text
Deployment orchestration — Vercel + Heroku

Deployment
Frontend hosted on Vercel
Backend deployed on Heroku
Environment variable configuration for API URLs

What I Learned & Next Steps
Skills gained: Full-stack integration, deployment, problem-solving
Future: API enhancements, UX improvements, testing
